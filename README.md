# Speak For You (S4U)
S4U is a project developed during HackUPC. The objective of this project was helping mute people to start communicating with others who donâ€™t know sign language, translating it in real time to voice with a mobile app and Myo technology.

## How it works?
S4U is an Android app that connects to a pair of Myo Gesture Control Armband via bluetooth and translates the movements of your arms and hands to your prefered language, using the Android TTS library.
